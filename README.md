# My codingbat solutions
My personal solutions to problems on https://codingbat.com/

- I decided to use codingbat to build a solid foundation for solving python problems
- Through completing many of these basic problems my ability to quickly use and recall tools has improved which is important and common in most programming problems.
- I applied `autopep8` to my final completed solutions, to ensure I used good style. Through the commit message where I can compare changes, almost nothing was changed except indentation - my coding bat solutions used a tab of 2 spaces, but proper style is using 4 spaces

I tried to implement most of the solutions without using built-in functions; although there are times when codingbat recommends a using a specfic function, such as the `endswith()` method, in which case they are used.
