# My codingbat solutions
My personal solutions to problems on https://codingbat.com/

- I decided to use codingbat to build a solid foundation for solving python problems
- Through completing many of these basic problems my ability to quickly use and recall tools has improved
- which is important and common in most programming problems.

I tried to implement most of the solutions without using built-in functions; although there are times when codingbat recommends a using a specfic function, such as the `endswith()` method, in which case they are used.
