# Coding Bat
My personal solutions to problems on https://codingbat.com/

I decided to use codingbat to build a solid foundation for solving simple python problems. Doing lots of these basic problems improves your ability to use and  remember tools which are extremely important and common in programming. I tried to implement most of the solutions without using built-in functions.
